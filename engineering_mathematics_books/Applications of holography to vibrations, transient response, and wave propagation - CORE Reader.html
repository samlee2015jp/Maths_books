Evensen \nand \nRobert  Aprahamian \nTRW  Systems  Group \nSUMMARY \nHolography  is  a  lensless  imaging  technique  which  allows  the  reconstruc- \ntion  of  three-dimensional  images.  A  related  technique,  called  holographic \ninterferometry,  allows  one  to  measure  static  or  dynamic  displacements on \nthe  order of a  wavelength  of  light.  The  present  report  is  concerned  with \nthe  application  of  these  holographic  techniques  to  three  areas  of  applied \nmechanics:  (i)  high-frequency  vibrations  of  beams  and  plates,  (ii) \ntransient  response  measurements,  and  (iii)  studies  of  transverse  wave \npropagation. \nHigh-Frequency  Vibrations \nTime-average  holography  was  used  to  identify  over 30 t ansverse  vibra- \ntion  modes  of a cantilever  beam.  The  fundamental  frequency  of  the  beam \nwas 9 cps,  and  the  highest  mode  identified  was  at 100,000 cps.  Photographs \nof  beam  v.5bration  modes  are  included  herein.  Similar  tests  were  run  using \n8\" x 10\". simply-supported  plate,  and  stored-beam  holographic  -interferometry \nwas  used  to  identify  the  plate  vibration  modes  in  real  time.  The  funda- \nmental  frequency  of  the  plate  was  162  cps,  and  over 100 modes  were  identi- \nfied  using  holography  at  frequencies  up to 76,768  cps.  Photographs  were \nmade  of  selected  modes,  and  several  are  included  herein.  The  experimental \npatterns  for  the  vibrating  plate  are  readily  interpreted,  and  the  rapid, \ngraphic  display  of  the  mode  shapes  in  real-time  makes  these  holographic \ntechniques  very  attractive.  To  emphasize  these  features  of  holography,  a \n10-minute  sound  movie  entitled  \"Vibration  Analysis  Using  Holographic \nInterferometry\"  was  produced.  Motion-picture  film  supplement L-1081 has \nbeen  prepared  and  is  available  on  loan.  A  request  card  and  a  description \nof the  film  are  included  at  the  back  of  this  document. \nThe  high-frequency  vibration  studies  demonstrated  that  holography  is \na  new and useful  tool  for  vibration  analysis. At frequencies  of 50,000 \ncps  and  above,  vibration  patterns  were  obtained  for  modes  which  had  not \nbeen  observed  by  any  other  means.  The  experimental  data  agreed  well  with \nvibration  theories  which  include  rotatory  inertia  and  shear  effects;  the \nexperiments-provided  verification  of  these  theories  at  high  frequencies. \nA possible  drawback  with  the  use  of  time-average  holography  for  some \napplications  is a restriction  to  small  amplitude  vibrations.  For  large \nvibration  amplitudes,  the  interference  fringes  can  crowd  together  and \nbecome  difficult  to  interpret. In addition,  time-average  holography  re- \nquires  that  the  optical  system  be  isolated  from  background  noise  and \nvibration.  Exploratory  studies  reported  herein  indicate  that  these  two \ndifficulties  can  be  overcome  by  the  use  of  pulsed  laser  holography.  This \nconclusion  is  supported  by  recent  work  using  pulsed  holography  for  large \namplitude  vibrations  of  noisy  subjects. \nTransient  Response \nThe  transient  response  of a 20\" cantilever  beam  was,determined  by \nusing  the  technique  of  stored-beam  (real-time)  holographic  interferometry \ncombined  with  high-speed  motion  picture  photography. A stored-beam  holo- \ngram  of  the  cantilever  beam  was  set  up,  and  the  beam  was  subjected  to a \ntransverse  impact  at  the  tip. A high-speed  motion  picture  camera  was \nplaced  behind  the  hologram  to  record  the  motion  of  the  interference  fringes \ncaused  by  the  impact.  The  data  contained  on  the  movie  film  was  reduced \nframe-by-frame  yielding  the  displacement-time  history  of  several  stations \nalong  the  length  of  the  beam.  The  experimental  results  were  compared  with \nanalytical  solutions  for  the  transient  response,  and  generally  good \nagreement  was  obtained. \nThe  transient  response  test  demonstrated  the  feasibility  of a new \nmeasuring  technique  which  had  not  been  used  previously.  This  technique  has \nthe  advantages  that  no  sensor  need  be  attached  to  the  structure,  and  that \ndata  can  be  easily  recorded  over a large  are  of  the  structure.  Displacement- \ntime  histories  of  individual  points  on  the  structure  can  be  obtained  sub- \nsequent  to viewing.the overall  response. A disadvantage  of  the  method  is \nthat  each  movie  frame  must  be  examined  individually,  which  turned  out  to  be \na laborious  task.  This  disadvantage  can  be  partially  overcome  by  using a \nphotocell-and-counter  technique,  but  this  approach  is  still  under  develop- \nment. \nWave  Propagation \nThe  transverse  wave  propagation  study  was  conducted  using  pulsed  laser \nholography. A bending  wave  was  initiated  in a long  beam  by  impacting  it  in \nthe  center  with a ballistic  pendulum.  Interferograms  of  the  bending  pulse \nwere  obtained  at  three  distinctly  separated  times,  and  changes  in  the  pulse \nshape  were  readily  detected  at  the  different  times.  Experimental  plots  of \nthe  bending  displacement vs. distance  along  the  beam  were  obtained,  and \nthese  results  were  in  good  agreement  with  analytical  results  for  the  problem. \nThe  wave  propagation  study  provided  the  first  photographs  of a bending \nwave  propagating  in a beam.  Previous  experiments  using  strain  gages  or \ndisplacement  pickups  gave  the  response  of  the  beam  (at  one  point)  as a \nfunction  of  time.  The  present  results  provide  the  displacement  as a \nfunction  of  the  distance  along  the  beam  (at  particular  time).  Further \n2 \nstudies of wave propagation problems using holography appear quite pro- \nmising, and pulsed laser holography w i l l  provide the basic experimental \ntechnique for these studies. \n3 \n1.0 INTRODUCTION \nHolography  is  a  lensless  imaging  process  which  allows  the  reconstruc- \ntion of three-dimensional  images  of  diffuse  objects  (Refs.  1,2). A \nrelated  technique,  known  as  holographic  interferometry  (Ref. 3 ) ,  allows \nthe  experimenter  to  measure  static  or  dynamic  displacements  on  the  order \nof a  wavelength of the  light  used  to  make  the  holograms  (Ref. 4 ) .  This \nnew  experimental  technique  repre'sents  a  powerful  tool  for  studying  problems \nin  experimental  mechanics.  Holographic  interferometry  has  been  applied \nto such  problems  as  wave  propagation  (Ref. 5), static  stress  measurements \n(Ref. 6), and  aerodynamic  flow  (Ref. 7,8). It was  first  applied  to  vibra- \ntion  analysis  by  Powell  and  Stetson  (Ref. 9 )  in  1965,  and  it  has  been \nextensively  applied  to  steady-state  vibrations  since  then  (Refs. 10, 11, \n12, 13). \nThe  basic  motivation  of  these  early  papers  on  the  applications  of \nholography  to  vibrations  was  to  demonstrate  the  feasibility  and  potential \nof  the  technique.  The  main  objective  of  the  present  investigation  was  to \nexploit  this  potential  in  the  areas  of  high-frequency  vibrations,  trans- \nient  motions,  and  the  propagation  o,f  transverse  bending  waves.  At  the \nstart  of  this  work  (1968)  the  following  assessment  was  made  with  respect \nto  the  state-of-the-art  concerning  high-frequency  vibrations: \nI t  With  present  non-holographic  measurement  techniques,  it  is  possible \nto  experimentally  determine  the  first 10 - 15  modes  or so of a  typical \nbeam  (or  beam-like  structure).  However,  holography  promises  an  increase \nin  measurement  capability  of  two  orders  of  magnitude;  thus  it  appears \nfeasible  to  determine  many  more  modes  than  was  formerly  possible.  For \nexample,  by  using  holography  it  may  be  possible  to  determine  the  first \n50 - 100 modes  of  a  beam,  instead  of  only 10 - 15. An analagous  situation \nexists  for  plates,  where  it  appears  that  it  may  be  possible  to  find  the \nfirst 100 - 300 modes.\" \n\"For  both  beams  and  plates,  shear  deformation  and  rotatory  inertia \ncan  have  a  significant  influence  on  the  higher  vibration  modes.  Using \nTimoshenko  beam  theory,  it  is  possible  to  estimate  the  alterations  in \nmode  shape  due  to  these  effects.  By  determining  the  higher  vibration  modes \nexperimentally  (using  holography)  one  would  be  in  a  position  to  make  some \nof the  first  direct  comparisons  between  theory  and  experiment  involving \nshear  deformation  and  rotatory  inertia.\" \nIn  retrospect,  now  that  the  work  has  been  completed,  it  is  safe  to \nsay  that  holography  lived  up  to  our  expectations. \nThe  work  reported  herein  is  divided  into  five  main  parts,  as  follows: \no Holography and Holographic  Interferometry \no Steady-State  Vibration  Tests \n4 \no Transient  Response Tests \no Wave Propagation  Study \no Suggestions  for  Future  Experiments \n\"he section on holography is intended to  explain the fundamentals  of t h e  \ntechnique  to  v ibra t ion  engineers  and o the r s  no t  a l r eady  familiar wi th  the  \ns\u0026ject. The s t eady- s t a t e  v ib ra t ion  tests inc lude  the  r e su l t s  o f  h igh  \nfrequency experiments on a 30-inch cantilever beam and an 8\" x 10\" simply- \nsuppor ted  rec tangular  p la te .  The fundamental frequency of the beam w a s  9 \ncps ,  and o v e r  t h i r t y  a d d i t i o n a l  t r a n s v e r s e  modes were i d e n t i f i e d ;  t h e  \ncorresponding resonant frequencies ranged from 500 cps  to  ove r  100,000 \ncps. The fundamental  frequency of the simply-supported plate was 162 \ncps, and more than  100  p la te  modes were i d e n t i f i e d  u s i n g  stored-beam \nin te r fe rometry ,  a t  f requencies  as high as 76,768  cps. Many of  these  p la te  \nmodes were recorded on time-average holograms, and photographs from \nseveral of the  holograms are included  herein.  The exper imenta l   pa t te rns  \nf o r  t h e  v i b r a t i n g  p l a t e  are r e a d i l y  i n t e r p r e t e d ,  and they are even more \ngraphic  than the well-known Chladni sand figures.  The resonant  f requencies  \nand mode shapes show good agreement  with the theory,  providing rotatory \ni n e r t i a  and s h e a r  e f f e c t s  are inc luded  for  the  h igher  modes. I n  a d d i t i o n  \nt o  b e i n g  d e s c r i b e d  h e r e i n ,  t h e  r e s u l t s  o f  t h e  beam v i b r a t i o n  s t u d i e s  are \nde ta i l ed  in  Refe rence  14 ,  and t h e  p l a t e  r e s u l t s  are repor ted  in  Reference  \n15. \nTransient  response tests were run using a 20-inch c a n t i l e v e r  beam \nand  stored-beam  holography.  In  this  technique, l ive in t e r f e rence  f r inges  \nwere formed when t h e  beam w a s  s u b j e c t e d  t o  a t ransverse impact  a t  t h e  t i p .  \nThe r ap id  movement of t he  in t e r f e rence  f r inges  w a s  recorded using a high- \nspeed motion picture  camera.

By then projecting l ight through the photographic fi lm (which i s  \nca l l ed  a \"hologram\") i t  i s  poss ib le  to  reproduce  a three-dimensional imag-e \no r  t h e  o r i g i n a l  o b j e c t .  \nThe reproduct ion of images as Gabor suggested became p r a c t i c a l  w i t h  \nthe advent of the .laser as a source of monochromatic, coherent light. In \n1964,.Leith  and  Upatnieks  (Ref. 2) demonstrated that a three-dimensional \nimage of an opaque objec t  could  be  recons t ruc ted  in  a manner similar t o  \nthat proposed by  Gabor. Figure 1 shows a typical  set-up of  the apparatus  \nused i n  t h e  L e i t h  and Upatnieks holographic method. \nLaser Laser \nS p a t i a l  F i l t e r  \nObserver \nFigure 1 - Lef t :  Image Recording  Process \nRight:  Image Re t r i eva l  \n6 \nIn  making the hologram, the l ight  waves from the  ob jec t  (ob jec t  beam) \ni n t e r a c t  w i t h  t h e  l i g h t  from the  mi r ro r  ( r e fe rence  beam). When t h e  l i g h t  \nfrom the  mi r ro r  is i n  phase  wi th  the  l i gh t  from t h e  o b j e c t ,  t h e  waves add; \nconversely,  the waves cancel one another when they are out  of phase. This \ntype of i n t e r a c t i o n  r e s u l t s  i n  v a r i a t i o n s  i n  t h e  i n t e n s i t y  of t h e  l i g h t  \ns t r ik ing  the  pho tograph ic  f i lm  ( these  are spatial  v a r i a t i o n s  i n  i n t e n s i t y ,  \ni n  t h e  p l a n e  of the hologram.)  Since photographic  f i lm reacts  to  the \ni n t e n s i t y  of l ight  impinging on i t ,  the exposed fi lm gives a permanent \nrecord of t h e  i n t e r a c t i o n  of t h e  two l i g h t  beams. \nTo r e c o n s t r u c t  t h e  image of t h e  o b j e c t  from the hologram, the de- \nveloped photographic fi lm is  il luminated with any monochromatic l ight \nsou rce ,  e .g . ,  t he  o r ig ina l  laser. Now the  l i gh t  i n t e rac t s  w i th  the  ho logram,  \nand t h e  r e s u l t  i s  a three-dimensional image of t h e  o r i g i n a l  o b j e c t .  Such \na recons t ruc ted  image can be qui te  impressive,  to  say the least. For  ex- \nample, Heflinger, Brooks, and Wuerker of T R W  Systems have made a hologram \nof a b u l l e t  i n  f l i g h t  ( R e f .  3 ) .  With the usual  schl ieren photographs of \na b u l l e t ,  t h e  shock  waves  appear as l i n e s  i n  t h e  p i c t u r e .  From the holo- \ngram,  however,  one is  a b l e  t o  see the conical ,  three-dimensional  nature  of \nthe shock waves. \nThe r econs t ruc t ion  of images i n  t h i s  f a s h i o n  can be described mathe- \nma t i ca l ly  as follows . \nIn  the formation of the hologram, l e t  t h e  l i g h t  coming from t h e  o b j e c t  \nbe denoted by \nwhere A, is t h e  real amplitude  and 9, is  the phase.  The harmonic f a c t o r  \nI i v  t I e has  been  omitted  for  convenience  in  Equation  (2-l) ,  and A1, 0, are t o  \nbe evaluated a t  the  p lane  of t h e  hologram. In  a similar f a s h i o n ,  t h e  l i g h t  \nfrom t h e  r e f e r e n c e  beam which reaches the plane of t h e  hologram can be \ndescribed by \nThe amplitude of t h e  l i g h t  impinging on t h e  hologram is the  sum of t h e  ob- \nject beam p l u s  t h e  r e f e r e n c e  beam, which g ives  \nU = O + R = A e  i$J 1 + A 2 e  iQ 2 1 \nThe hologram, which is a photographic  p la te ,  responds  to  the  in tens i ty  of  \nt h e  l i g h t .  The l i g h t  i n t e n s i t y  i n  t h e  p l a n e  of t h e  hologram i s  given by \n7 \nI = UU* = A + A2 + A A ei('1-'2) + A1A2e 2 1 2 2  (9 -4 1 1 1 2  \nwhere U* denotes  the complex conjugate of U. Since  the  photographic  f i lm \nre sponds  to  the  in t ens i ty ,  I, a recording of Equation (2-4) is  made by t h e  \nhologram. \nWhen t h e  hologram is re- i l luminated by the reference beam (and the \nob jec t  removed from the  scene )  t he  l i gh t  t r ansmi t t ed  by the hologram is  \ngiven by L = R ( t ransmi t tance)  = R(1-KI)  where K is a cons tan t ;  i .e . ,  \n- KIA1 2 + A2  + A1A2ei('l -4 2 1 + A1A2e i(92-41) 1) (2-5) \nO r ,  mul t iplying out  the individual  terms, \nL = [l-K(A1 + A2)l A2e  2 - KAlA2e 1 - KA A e 2  2 i 9  2 i 4  2 i ( 2 + ~ ~ - 9 ~ )  1 2  \nThe f i r s t  term in  Equat ion  (2-6) is e q u i v a l e n t  t o  t h e  o r i g i n a l  r e f e r e n c e  \nbeam A e i 9  2 ,  but  i t  has been modified by the scalar 1 - K(A1 + A2). The \nsecond term contains  A ei91, and as such it is  e q u i v a l e n t  t o  t h e  l i g h t  \ncoming f rom the  or ig ina l  ob jec t  (mul t ip l ied  by  the  scalar - KA2). Thus \ni t  is the  second term which gives rise t o  t h e  r e c o n s t r u c t e d  image of t h e  \no r i g i n a l  o b j e c t .  The t h i r d  term in  Equat ion  (2-6) r ep resen t s  a conjugate \nwave, and i t  may be regarded as emanating from a f i c t i t i o u s  b u t  i d e n t i c a l  \no b j e c t  s i t u a t e d  i n  a d i f f e ren t  p l ane .  \n2  2 \n2 \n1 2 \nThis brief discussion of the mathematics behind the holographic pro- \ncess con ta ins  on ly  the  ba re  e s sen t i a l s  and neg lec t s  many of t h e  t e c h n i c a l  \nde t a i l s  i nvo lved .

The e s s e n t i a l   i d e a s  are as f o l l o w s :   f i r s t  make a \nhologram of the  ob jec t  you wish t o  examine;  then subject  the object  to  \nloads which cause i t  t o  deform, and expose the same hologram f o r  a second \ntime. Now when t h i s  \"double-exposed  hologram'' is developed  and  then \n8 \ni l lumina ted ,  two images are produced:  one i s  from t h e  undeformed  body, t h e  \nother from the deformed body. These light waves (which  form t h e  two im- \nages) interact  wi th  one  another ,  thereby  crea t ing . in te r fe rence  f r inge  \npa t t e rns .  By ana lyz ing  the  f r inge  pa t te rns ,  one  can  de termine  the  sur face  \ndeformations of the body, which were caused by the applied load. Haines \nand Hildebrand (Ref. 4) give expressions which show how t o  relate t h e  \nin t e r f e rence  f r inges  wi th  the  su r face  de fo rma t ions  o f  t he  ob jec t .  An \nextensive mathematical  descr ipt ion of  holographic  interferometry was pre- \ns e n t e d  r e c e n t l y  i n  R e f .  20. \nHolographic  tnterferometry is exemplified by pulsed laser holography, \nwhich w a s  u sed  he re in  to  r eco rd  a t r ansve r se  wave propagating along a \nbeam. F i r s t  t h e  laser w a s  pulsed once to  expose the hologram showing a \ns t a t i o n a r y  beam. Then a stress wave w a s  i n i t i a t e d  i n  t h e  beam, and a \nsecond pulse of the laser was timed t o  expose the hologram when the  wave \nhad  t rave led  par t  way a long  the  beam. The r e s u l t i n g  double-exposed  holo- \ngram w a s  developed and i ts  f r i n g e  p a t t e r n  w a s  ana lyzed  to  obta in  the  shape  \nof the bending wave.

The more usual  technique \n( fo r  s t eady- s t a t e  v ib ra t ions )  is time-average holography, which i s  d i s -  \ncussed  in  the  nex t  s ec t ion .  \nTime-Average Holography \nTo understand time-average holography, i t  is i n s t r u c t i v e  t o  c o n s i d e r  \nthe ordinary time-exposure photography of a v ib ra t ing  ob jec t ,  such  as a \nswinging pendulum. A s  t h e  pendulum swings  back  and  forth, i ts  ve loc i ty  i s  \na maximum a t  the bottom of t h e  swing and goes t o  z e r o  when the  pendulum \nreaches i t s  maximum displacement.  In a time exposure of the swinging \npendulum, then ,  t he  f i lm  is exposed primarily where the verocity i s  zero \n( a t  t h e  extremes of the swing) and is  exposed very l i t t l e  where the veloc-  \ni t y  is a m a x i m u m .  A time-averaged hologram of a v i b r a t i n g  o b j e c t  is  \nd i r ec t ly  ana logous  to  the  t i m e  exposure  of  the pendulum. F i r s t ,  t h e  o b j e c t  \nt o  b e  s t u d i e d  is set i n t o  v i b r a t i o n  i n  o n e  of i t s  resonant modes. Then \na hologram is  made by exposing the photographic  plate  for  a \"long\" period \nof t i m e  (e.g. several v ib ra t ion  pe r iods ) .  Because of t h e  s i n u s o i d a l  n a t u r e  \nof  the vibrat ion,  the hologram is  exposed primarily when the ampli tude of \nv i b r a t i o n  i s  a t  i t s  maximum (and t h e  v e l o c i t y  is  zero) .  The r e s u l t  i s  a \nhologram which y i e l d s  a f r i n g e  p a t t e r n  t h a t  r e p r e s e n t s  peak-to-peak d i s -  \nplacement i n  a normal mode. By ana lyz ing  the  f r inge  pa t t e rn  from  such a \ntime-average hologram i t  is possible  to  measure the surface displacements  \nof t h e  v i b r a t i n g  body.

This  type  of  holography  gives  rise  to  \"live\"  inter- \nference  fringes,  which  shift  and  change  as  the  object  of  interest  moves \nand  deforms.  In  the  live  fringe  method,  a  hologram  of  the  undeformed, \nstationary  object  is  made  and  developed.  This  hologram  is  then  very  care- \nfully  put  back  in  its  original  position,  i.e.,  it  is  put  back  in  the \nphotographic  plate  holder  where  it  was  originally  held.  The  hologram  is \nthen  illuminated  by  the  laser  and  reconstructs  an  image  of  the  undeformed \nobject  superimposed  on  the  real  object.  Now  suppose  the  object  being \nstudied  is  allowed  to  deform:  then  the  light  from  the  deformed  body \ninteracts  with  the  stored  image  of  the  undeformed  body  (produced  by  the \nhologram)  and  a  live  interference  fringe  pattern  is  formed. \nWhen  this  live  fringe  technique  is  applied  to  an  object  which  is \nvibrating  sinusoidally  in  a  normal  mode,  the  fringe  pattern  appears to b  \nstationary  to  the  experimenter.  In  actuality,  the  fringe  pattern  shifts \nand  changes  rapidly,  but  the  human  eye  acts  as  a  time-averaging  device \nand  the  fringe  pattern  seen  by  the  observer  is  much  like  that  from  a  time- \naverage  hologram. A discussion  of  vibration  analysis  in  real-time  using \nthe  stored-beam  technique  is  given  in  Ref.  21.  Other  studies  using  real- \ntime  holography  are  given  in  Ref.  22. \nAnother  technique  which  uses  stored-beam  principles  is  stroboscopic \nholographic  interferometry  (Ref.  23).  In  this  technique,  the  laser  beam \nis  flashed  periodically  in  synchronization  with  the  vibration  being  ob- \nserved. A common  procedure  is to use  a  variable  speed  motor  with  a  disc \nmounted  on  it to interrupt  the  laser  beam  periodically. A hologram  of \nthe  stationary,  undeformed  object  is  also  used  in  the  stroboscopic  method. \nAlthough  this  technique  was  not  used  herein,  it  does  have  application  to \nvibration  analysis  and  may  be  of  interest to some  readers;  see  Refs.  10, \n23,  and  24. \n10 \nI \n3.0 STEADY-STATE VIBRATION TESTS \nSummary \nThis  sec t ion  conta ins  a desc r ip t ion  o f  t he  s t eady- s t a t e  v ib ra t ion  \ntests which were conducted on a c a n t i l e v e r  beam and a simply-supported \nr ec t angu la r  p l a t e .

Since the primary \npurpose was  t o  i n v e s t i g a t e  transverse v i b r a t i o n  modes (as opposed t o  t o r -  \ns i o n a l  modes) it was necessa ry  to  d i s t ingu i sh  the  type  of resonant response. \nIt w a s  readi ly  determined form the osci l loscope that  the t ransverse modes \nexhibi ted the usual  l inear  resonance peaks,  whereas  the tors ional  modes \nposses sed  no t i ceab le  non l inea r i t i e s  i n  the i r  r e sponse .  Th i s  d i s t inc t ion  \nmade it possible  to  photograph only the desired t ransverse modes. \nI n i t i a l  a t t e m p t s  t o  make time-average holograms of t h e  v i b r a t i n g  beam \nwere unsuccessful ,  due to  the presence of undesirable responses of the \nlower modes of t he  beam. These  low-frequency  motions were exc i ted  by such \nth ings  as seismic d i s tu rbances  and  veh icu la r  t r a f f i c  which were s u f f i c i e n t  \nt o  move t h e  beam more than one wavelength of t h e  l i g h t  employed t o  make \nthe holograms. This problem w a s  overcome  by designing a support  with a \npointed metal s tud  which could be positioned a t  a node of t he  des i r ed  \nmode. This support  prevented the low frequency modes from being exci ted,  \nand success fu l  holograms were made with i t  i n  place. A photograph obtained \nfrom one such hologram is shown in  F igu re  6 ,  which w i l l  be  discussed short ly .  \nIn  addi t ion to  using the t ime-averaging technique to  record the modes, \nan a t t e m p t  w a s  made t o  employ l i v e  f r i n g e  i n t e r f e r o m e t r y  t o  i d e n t i f y  t h e  \nmodes.

Then t h e  \ndeveloped hologram w a s  pu t  back  in to  the  p la te  ho lder  and t h e  beam w a s  \nexc i ted  by the  driving  transducer.   This  arrangement  produced  l ive  fringes \nnear  the  root  of  the  beam,  and the type of mode ( t o r s i o n a l  and t r ansve r se )  \ncould  be  readi ly  ident i f ied  by d i r ec t  v i sua l  obse rva t ion .  The l i v e  f r i n g e  \nprocedure was used t o  i d e n t i f y  a mode a t  99,395 cps, and then a t i m e -  \naverage hologram was made to record the complete mode shape.

For  purposes  of  analysis,  the  central  axis  of  the  beam \nwas  used  to  determine  the  mode  shapes. \nThe  fringe  patterns  were  interpreted  by  using  the  analysis  presented \nby  Powell and Stetson  (Ref. 9). Their  results  show  that  the  amplitude \nof  vibration  for  points  on  the  beam  which  are  covered  by a f inge  can  be \nrelated  to  the  roots  of Jo, the  zero-order  Bessel  function.  That  is, a \nfringe  is  formed  where \nJo (ai) = 0 (3-1) \nand  Qi  is  defined  by \na i -  X \n” 2.rr [cosel + C O S ~ ~ ] A ~  \nwhere \nX is  the  wavelength  of  light  used  to  make  the  holograms \n€I1 is  the  angle  between  the  displacement  vector  of  the  beam  and \nthe  line  of  sight  of  the  observer  through  the  hologram \nis  the  angle  between  the  displacement  vector  of  the  beam  and \nthe  illuminating  light  source \nAi is  the  amplitude  of  vibration  (at  fringe  i) \nThe  angles 8 and O 2  are  shown  in  Figure 7.

At Sll, the  first  root  of \nJo, we have \nfor  the  amplitude  of  vibration  at  the  location  of  the  first  fringe. \nSimilarly,  the  vibration  amplitude  A2  corresponds  to  the  second  root, \nQ2, etc.  Near  the  center  of  the  beam,  the  -optical  arrangement  was  such \nthat O1 = =: 0 and  the  amplitudes  are  especially  easy  to  compute.

Photographs  made  from \ntypical  holograms  are  shown  in  Figure  9.  Four  very  high-frequency  modes \nare  shown  in  Figure 10. Appendix  B  contains  additional  beam  vibration \nmodes  and  their  associated  frequencies. \nEquations  (3-1)  and  (3-2)  were  used  to  determine  the  shape  of  the \n21st  mode  from  the  corresponding  hologram.  This  experimentally  determined \nmode  shape  was  compared  with  the  results  of  a  typical  computer  program \n(Ref.  25)  which  employs  Timoshenko  Beam  Theory;  the  comparison  is  illus- \ntrated  in  Figure 11. Discrepancies  near  the  tip  are  probably  due  to  the \neffect of the  driving  transducer. \nAdditional  mode  shapes  and  frequencies  were  calculated, nd these  re- \nsults  were  compared  with  the  corresponding  experimental  values.  Such a \ncomparison  on  the  basis  of  frequency  versus  mode  number  is  shown  in  Figure \n21  \nFRINGE  PATTERN \nx \nBEAM DISPLACEMENT \n10.9 x \nFigure 8 - Typical   Fr inge  Pat tern  and Corre'sponding \nVibratory Displacement.  \n22 \n(a)   5th rode, f = 500 cps \n( b )  15th mode, f = 5155 cps \n( c )  24th mode, f = 13,148 cps \n(d)  34th mde, f = 25,665 cps \nFigure 9 - Transverse Vibration Modes (Cant i lever  Beam) \n23 \n( a )   P l a t e - t y p e  Mode, f = 71 ,662 cps \n(b)  P l a t e - t y p e  Mode, f = 100,315  cps \n( c )   T o r s i o n a l  Mode, f = 72,846 cps \n(d )   T ransverse  Mode, f = 99,395  cps \nF i g u r e  10 - High Frequency Beam Modes \n24 \nEXPERIMENTAL DATA \n- TIMOSHENKO BEAM THEORY \nw \n3 \nn \nt; \nJ \n% \nDISTANCE FROM FIXED E N D  OF BEAM (INCHES) \nFigure 11 - Comparison o f  the  Experimental and Calculated Shape for \nthe 21st Mode (Cantilever Beam) \n12. As illustrated  therein,  the  calculated  frequency  (based  upon \nTimoshenko  Beam  Theory)  compares  very  well  with  the  experiments.  The  data \npoints  plotted  in  Figure  12  are  also  given  directly  in  Table 11.\nIn order  to  find  the  limitations  of  the  experimental  technique, \nholograms  were  made  of  the  beam  vibrating in selected  modes  up  to  the  77th, \nwhich  occurred  at  a  frequency of 99,395 cps  (see  Figure lo). Other  modes \nbetween  the  34th  and  77th  were  identified and the  corresponding  frequencies \nwere  noted.  For  these  very  high  modes,  the  influence  of  boundary  conditions \nbecomes  unimportant,  and  the  frequencies  can  be  calculated  from  the  case  of \na  traveling  wave  in  an  infinitely  long  beam.  Using  Timoshenko  Beam  Theory \nthe  resulting  frequency  equation  is  given  by  (Ref.  26): \nE (k) - (:) 2[\u003e(f)-2 + 1 + €IS+ 1 = 0 (3-4) \nwhere \n1/2 \nc 0 =(+) is  the  bar  velocity \nc  is  the  phase  velocity \nA is  the  wavelength  of  the  bending  wave \nd is  the  depth  of  the  (rectangular)  cross-section \n2(1 + v )  \nR' E =  \nwhere v is  Poisson's  ratio  and  R'  is  5/6  for  a  rectangular  cross-section. \nThe  wavelength A was  determined  from  the  holograms,  and  the  frequency, f, \nwas  measured  directly  by  the  electronic  counter.  By  using  the  relation \nc = fA,  it  was  possible to plot  (c/c ) vs A/d from  the  experiments. \nThese  experimental  results  were  compared  with  the  lowest  root  of  equation \n(3-4)  as  shown  in  Figure  13. The close  agreement  shown  in  Figure  13  again \ndemonstrates  the  validity of Timoshenko  Beam  Theory  for  the  vibration \nproblem  at  hand.  In  interpreting  Figure 13, note  that  the  low-frequency \nlong-wavelength  modes  lie  near  the  origin;  as  one  moves  out  along  the \ncurves,  away  from  the  origin,  the  frequencies  increase  and  the  wavelengths \nbecome  shorter. \n0 \nAlthough  the  main  objective  was  to  record  transverse  modes,  additional \nmodes  were  found  in  which  the  beam  vibrated  like  a  cantilevered  plate. \nFigures  10(a)  and 10(b) show  modes  in  which  there  are  two  nodal  lines \nparallel t o  the  longitudinal  axis of the  beam.  Several  transverse  nodal \nlines  are  also  shown  in  the  photograph,  and  these  modes  are  classified  as \nvibration  pattern,  an  antisymmetric  mode  (a  torsional  mode)  with  a  nodal \nline  along  the  central  axis of the  beam. An additional  torsional  mode  is \nshown  in  Appendix B. \n'I cantilever  plate  modes.\"  Figure  1O(c)  shows  another  related  type of \n26 \n20 \n18 \n16 \n14 \n12 \nh \nul \nE- 10 \nv \nY \n\u003e u z \nW \n3 \nw \n!x \nLL. \n0 8  \n6 \n4 \n2 \n0 \n1 '3 5 7 9 11 13  15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 \nMODE NUMBER-n \nFigure 12 - Natural  Frequency as a Function o f  \nMode Number (Cantilever Beam) \n27 \n1 \nTABLE I1 \nRESONANT  FREQUENCIES  (CANTILEVER  BEAM) \nMODE \nNUMBER \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n1 0  \n11 \n12  \nEXPERIMENTAL \nFREQUENCY  (CPS) \n9 \n500 \n746 \n1044 \n1385 \n1777 \n2214 \n2698 \n3262 \n3843 \n4477 \n5155 \n58  70 \n6640 \n7454 \n8308 \n9204 \n10  , 1 2 1  \n11 , 106 \n1 2  , 111 \n13,148 \n1 4  , 200 \n15 , 365 \n16 , 401 \n17,550 \n19 , 085 \n20 , 336 \n9 -06  \n56.77 \n158.8 \n310.9 \n513.2 \n765.2 \n1066.5 \n1416 .4  \n1814 .1  \n2259 \n2750 \n3287 \n3868 \n44  92 \n5158 \n5866 \n6613 \n7399 \n8223 \n9084 \n9979 \n1 0  , 908 \n11 , 870 \n1 2  , 864 \n13,947 \n15 , 364 \n16 , 158* \n17,350* \n1 8  , 700* \n1 9  , 800* \nCALCULATED  FREQUENCIES \nTIMOSHENKO 1 BERNOULLI - EULER \n- \n9.06 \n56.8 \n159.0 \n311.7 \n515.3 \n770.0 \n1075.8 \n1431.3 \n1838.5 \n229 7 \n2805 \n3365 \n39 76 \n4638 \n5350 \n6113 \n6928 \n7793 \n8 709 \n9676 \n10,693 \n11 , 762 \n12  , 882 \n1 4  , 052 \n15 , 274 \n16 , 546 \n17 , 869 \n1 9  , 243 \n20 , 668 \n22 , 144 \n28 \n1 \n.5 \n.4 \n.1  \n0 \n0 \nEXPERIMENTAL DATA \n.1 .2 . 3  \nBEAM DEPTH \nBENDING  WAVELENGTH \nFigure 13 - Phase Velocity as a Function o f  Wavelength (Cantilever Beam) \nIn addi t ion  to  ident i fy ing  h igh- f requency  transverse, t o r s i o n a l ,  and \nc a n t i l e v e r  p l a t e  modes, it was des i r ed  to  measu re  the  damping value asso- \nc i a t ed  wi th  a high-frequency mode. .For  th i s  purpose ,  the  21s t  mode w a s  \nexc i t ed  to  r e sonance  and  then  the  exc i ta t ion  was abrupt ly  terminated.  \nThe exponent ia l  decay of t h e  v i b r a t i o n  w a s  monitored by the pickup trans- \nducer;  a very clean decay trace resulted,  which gave a Logarithmic decre- \nment va lue  6 = 1.59 x The associated  f requency was 10,121  cps , and \nno ind ica t ion  o f  \"bea t ing\"  o r  exc i t a t ion  of ad jacent  modes w a s  evident .  \nP la te  Vibra t ion  Modal Survey \nExperimental Set-up. - The p l a t e  which was t e s t e d  was made from 1/16\" \nt h i c k  aluminum shee t  (6061-T6).

Now  let \n2 rnr  nr  21T 2 2 + B2 = ( a '  + (b '  = (12' (3-9) \nbe  used  to  define  a  wavelength, A ,  and  let w = (-)c define  a  wave  speed, \nc.  Then  equation  (3-8)  can  be  put  in  the  form \n21T \nA \n(3-10) \nwhere c = E and c = G. The factor K' is a function of Poisson's \np(l-v2) S P \nratio,  and  it  was  determined  by  using  expressions  given  in  (Ref. 27). \nValues  of I, = 0.3  and K~ = 0.86  were  used  in  equation  (3-lo),  and  the \nsmallest  root  (c/c ) was  determined  as  a  function f (h/A).  This  procedure \nresulted  in  a  calculated  curve of nondimensional  wave  speed  as  a  function \nof (plate  thickness/bending  wavelength). \ns \nExperimental  values  for  (c/c ) and  h/A  were  obtained  using  the  m  and \nS \nn  numbers of the  various  modes  and  their  corresponding  frequencies. In \nparticular,  the  experimental  wavelength  was  determined  from  equation  (3-9), \nusing  a = 8\" and  b = lo\".  Similarly,  the  wave  speed  was  calculated  from \nc = fA, where f is  the  experimental  frequency  and A came  from  equation \n(3-9).  The  experimental  data  was  nondimensionalized  using c =(G/p) \n1.219  x 10 in/sec. A comparison of the  theoretical  and  experimental \nvalues  of  wave  speed  as  a  function  of  wave  length  is  shown  in  Figure  23. \n1/2 \n5 S \nAll  the  results  plotted  in  Figure  22  as  a  one-parameter  family of \ncurves  can  be  reduced  to  the  single  curve  of  Figure  23.  The  straight \nline  in  Figure  23  was  obtained  using  classical  plate  theory,  which  neglects \nrotatory  inertia  and  shear  effects.  The  curved  line  shows  Mindlin's \nplate  theory,  which  includes  these  effects.  The  three  experimental  points \nat  the  largest  values  of  h/A  were  obtained  from  the  three  very  high  fre- \nquency  modes  discussed  previously.  The  other  points  shown  in  Figure  23 \nare  representative  examples  of  other  modes  ranging  in  frequency  from  162 \nto  20,892  cps.  Figure  23  demonstrates  that  classical  plate  theory  agrees \nwith  the  experiments  for  values  of  (h/A)  less  than 0.06. Beyond  that \npoint,  the  experiments  agree  more  closely  with  Mindlin's  plate  theory. \nThe  modal  numbers  m  and  n  were  easily  determined  by  viewing  the \ninterference  fringe  patterns.

These \ndevia t ions  were a t t r i b u t e d   t o   t h e   s l i g h t  elastic moment restraint a t  t h e  \nboundaries. \nMode shapes could be determined most easily for the lower modes, i n  \nwhich several concentr ic  f r inges enclosed each ant inode.  The very high \nmodes usua l ly  had only a s ingle  f r inge around each ant inode,  and conse- \nquently the corresponding mode shapes could not  be closely resolved.  \nNevertheless, it is clear from Figures 1 9  and 20 tha t  the  exper imenta l  \nmodes possessed the basic \"checker-board' '  character given by equation \n(3-5).

When the  proper  vol tage  is  app l i ed  to  the  Pocke l s  \ncell ,  l i g h t  is al lowed to  pass  and the laser is p e r m i t t e d  t o  lase.

After 900 psecs the f lashlamp begins  \nt o  l o s e  its i n t e n s i t y  and consequently the rod loses its energy. \nI n  summary, then,  the laser r equ i r e s  tha t  (1 )  t he  f l a sh lamp  be  f l a shed  \nabout 800 psecs  before  las ing,  and (2)  the Pockels  c e l l  must be  ac t iva t ed  \n800 - 900 psecs a f t e r  f l a s h i n g  t h e  f l a s h l a m p .  \nTiming Sequence f o r  a Test \nIn performing the wave propagat ion experiment ,  e lectronic  components \nwere arranged to  provide two e lec t r ica l  pulses  - one t o  activate t h e  \nf lashlamp and the second to  t r igger  the Pockels  ce l l .

When  the  surface \ntemperature  of  the  structure  exceeds  500°F  or so ,  conventional  vibration \npick-ups  (such  as  capacitance  or  inductance  probes)  tend  to  run  into \ndifficulties.  Preliminary  results  indicate  that  holography  can  be  used \nfor  vibration  studies  of  plates  at  temperatures  as  high  as  1500 - 2000'F. \nIn  fact,  it  appears  that  holography  may  be  the  only  technique  which  is \npractical  at  such  temperatures. \nPulsed  Laser  Experiments  on  the  Vibration  of  Large,  Noisy  Subjects* \nTime-average  holography  and  stored-beam  interferometry  are  limited \nin  application  to  small  amplitude  vibrations. If large  vibration  ampli- \ntudes  are  used  with  these  holographic  techniques,  the  interference  fringes \ncrowd  closely  together  in  regions f high  slopes  and  cannot  be  readily \ndistinguished  from  one  another.  For  example, a slope  of 6 x lom4  radians \ncorresponds to a fringe  spacing of 0.01 inches  when  light  of  6328  Angstroms \nis  used.  Larger  slopes  result  in  even  closer  fringe  spacing.  This  limi- \ntation  on  allowable  vibration  amplitudes  is a fundamental  drawback  to \napplying  holography  with  large-scale,  flexible  structures. \nAnother  limitation of the  holographic  techniques  used  to  date  for \nvibration  analysis  is  the  fact  that  the  entire  system  must  be  isolated \nfrom  background  vibrations  and  noise.  This  isolation  requirement  presents \na problem  when  large-scale  structures  are  involved. \nTo overcome  these  limitations  of  present  techniques  for  holographic \nvibration  analysis,  the  use  of  pulsed  laser  holography  appears  very  pro- \nmising.  Consider  what  happens  if a structure  is  vibrating,  sinusoidally \nin a normal  mode,  and a double  exposure  hologram  is  made  by  pulsing  the \nlaser  once  at  time t and  again  at  time t From  the  first  pulse,  we \nhave  the  displacement \n1 2' \nwhere \nA is \nw is \nand tl is \nThe  second \n@ (x\u003e \n-f 3 \nw,(x,t) = A @(x) sin  utl \nthe  amplitude , \nrepresents  the  mode  shape, \nthe  vibration  frequency \nthe  time  of  the  first  exposure \npulse  at  time t gives  the  displacement 2 \n+- \nw2(x,t\u003e = A @(x) sin  ut2 \n+- \n*The  work  reported  in  this  section  was  sponsored  by TRW Systems  and  was \nnot  conducted  on  contract  NAS-1-8361. It is  reported  herein  for  purposes \nof  information  exchange. \nThe i n t e r f e r e n c e  p a t t e r n s  which forms is  a measure of  the difference in  dis-  \nplacements a t  time t and t2.

It may  be  advisable  to  use  a \ncombination of time-average  holography  (to  find  nodal  lines)  and  pulsed \nholography  (to  determine  mode  shapes) in actual  practice. \nTransient  Measurements  Using  a  Photocell-Counter  Technique* \nSection 4 . 0  of  this  report  discusses  transient  response  measurements \nusing  high-speed  movies  to  record  the  fringe  motion. As indicated  therein, \nconsiderable  time  was  required  to  read  the  individual  movie  frames  and  to \nreduce  the  data  from  them.  This  data  reduction  procedure  involves  counting \nfringes  and  determining  the  direction n which  the  fringes  are  moving. \nOne  means  of  automating  the  data  reduction  procedure  is  to  use  a  photo- \ncell  (a  photomultiplier  tube)  to  \"count\"  the  fringes  directly  as  they  move. \nTo understand  the  use  of  the  photocell,  consider  Figure  50. A stored-beam \nhologram  is  made  of  the  stationary  object,  and  subsequent  motion  of  the \nobject  results  in  live  interference  fringes  which  can  be  used  to  trigger \nthe  photocell.  For  example,  as  the  object  (e.g.,  a  cantilever  beam)  moves \ntoward  the  hologram,  fringes  will  form  on  the  surface  and  they  will  move \nup  or  down  the  beam  (Figure  50),  depending  upon  its  slope.  If  the  beam  is \nvibrating in its  fundamental  mode,  the  fringes  will  move  toward  the  root \nof  the  beam  when  the  beam  moves  toward  the  .hologram.  As  each  fringe  passes \nthe  point  where  the  photocell  is  focused,  the  voltage  output  of  the  photo- \ncell  will  drop.  Between  fringes,  the  light  reflected  from  the  cantilever \nilluminates  the  photocell  and  the  voltage  output  reaches  a  maximum.  Thus \nas  several  fringes  move  rapidly  along  the  beam,  the  output  voltage  from  the \nphotocell  will  be  a  series  of  peaks  and  valleys,  with  each  valley  corres- \nponding  to  the  passage  of  a  fringe.  Since  the  distance  between  fringes \n(in  a  direction  normal  to  the  cantilever)  corresponds  to  a  displacement  of \none-half  a  wavelength  (X/2),  the  photocell  output  recorded  on  the  oscillo- \nscope  can  be  directly  converted  into  a  displacement-time  history. \nA photocell  arrangement  of  this  type  has  been  used  at  TRW  to  obtain \nthe  displacement-time  history  of  the  free  end  of  an  aluminum  rod  which  was \nimpacted  by  a  ballistic  pendulum.  The  results  are  shown  in  Figures 51 and\n52, which  show  the  photocell  output and the  displacement-time  history, \nrespectively.  Note  that  the  time  scale  is  in  microseconds  which  gives  an \nindication  of  the  high  frequency-response  capability  of  the  photocell  tech- \nnique. \nThe  method  can  be  further  improved  by  using  the  photocell  output  to \ntrigger  an  electronic  counter,  which  would  count  the  fringes.  The  counter \ncould  be  connected  to  a  digital-to-analog  converter.  and  the  analog  signal \nsent  to  an  oscilloscope to give  a  displacement-time  history  directly. \nAdditional  development  work is needed  for  such  an  automatic  system.  The \nend  result  would  be  a  holographic  displacement  measuring \nsensitivity  and  good  high  frequency  capability.  Further \nlines  is  planned  at  TRW,and  all  indications  are  that  the \nis  feasible. \ndevice  having  high \nwork  along  these \npropos d  technique \n*This  work  was  not  performed  on  contract  NAS  1-8361. \n90 \n\nFigure 51 - Oscilloscope Trace of the Photocell O u t p u t ;  \nA1 umi num Cy1 i nder Subjected to  Longitudinal Impact \nI \" i \n60 80 100 120 140 \nTime - usec \nFigure 52 - Displacement-Time History o f  Free End o f  Cylinder \n92 \nIt should be noted that  the photocel l  technique provides  displacement-  \ntime h i s t o r i e s  a t  a poin t ,  ra ther  than  over  an  area.
